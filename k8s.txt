Kubernetes 
•	Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool used to manage Docker containers.
•	I use Kubernetes to deploy, scale, and manage applications automatically.
•	Kubernetes helps keep the application running without downtime.

Cluster & Nodes
•	A Kubernetes cluster has one master node and multiple worker nodes.
•	The master node controls the entire cluster.
•	Worker nodes run the application containers.

Pod
•	A Pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes.
•	One pod can run one or more containers.
•	In real time, I deploy applications inside pods.

Deployment
•	Deployment is used to manage application versions.
•	I use deployment to update applications without downtime.
•	Kubernetes creates new pods and removes old pods automatically.

ReplicaSet & Scaling
•	ReplicaSet ensures the required number of pods are running.
•	I use auto-scaling to handle high traffic.
•	If one pod goes down, Kubernetes creates a new pod automatically.

Service
•	Service is used to expose the application to users.
•	It provides a stable IP address to access pods.
•	I use NodePort or LoadBalancer services in real projects.

ConfigMap & Secret
•	ConfigMap is used to store application configuration data.
•	Secret is used to store sensitive data like passwords and tokens.
•	I never hard-code credentials inside the application.

Namespace
•	Namespace is used to separate environments like dev, test, and prod.
•	It helps in resource management and access control.

Health Checks
•	Liveness probe checks whether the app is running or not.
•	Readiness probe checks whether the app is ready to receive traffic.
•	These help avoid application downtime.

Rolling Update & Rollback
•	Rolling update deploys new versions without stopping the app.
•	If an issue occurs, I rollback to the previous version.
•	This is very important in production environments.

Monitoring & Logs
•	I use Prometheus for monitoring Kubernetes metrics.
•	I use Grafana to visualize performance data.
•	Logs help me debug real-time issues quickly.

Real-Time Scenario 
•	If a pod crashes, Kubernetes restarts it automatically.
•	If traffic increases, Kubernetes scales the pods automatically.
•	This reduces manual work and improves application reliability.
